Drawing on relatable use cases from budgeting and program evaluation to spatial analysis and predictive modeling, the book walks you through every step: installing R and RStudio, importing and cleaning messy datasets, running core statistical tests, and producing publication worthy visualizations. Each chapter balances technical rigor with accessible examples, ensuring you not only learn the syntax but also understand how to translate insights into actionable decisions that enhance transparency, accountability, and community impact. By blending theory with practice, R for Public Managers equips you with the confidence and skills to make data-driven decisions that drive better public outcomes.\nCongress at the Crossroads: Revisiting Dodd and Reimagining Reform\nEdited by Keith E. Lee Jr. and Kevin Baron\nCongress stands at a historic inflection point, marked by heightened polarization, institutional logjams, and evolving party forces. In this edited volume, former students of Dr. Larry Dodd examine Congress through a Doddian lens to illuminate how past patterns of party empowerment, committee reform, and realignment continue to shape today’s legislature. Through rich historical case studies, original empirical analyses, and forward-looking essays, contributors diagnose current challenges, from gridlock and executive-legislative tensions to committee turf wars, and propose pragmatic pathways for revitalizing congressional capacity. By bridging Dodd’s classic insights with contemporary realities, Congress at the Crossroads offers students, scholars, and reform advocates a fresh, cycle-informed framework for understanding and reimagining the future of the U.S. House and Senate.\n\n\nBook Chapters\n“Cyber Capabilities and Counterterrorism”\nFollowing the attacks on 9/11, many countries throughout the world looked to shore up Internet regulation in order to thwart future attacks (Watney 2007). Rich, analytical summations of different legal, ethical, or policy-based discussions of efforts to counter terrorism through various regulatory means (e.g., West 2021). One strand of such work follows the evolution of cybersecurity capacity building (CCB), whereby scholars such as Pawlak and Barmpaliou (2016) have commented on the uneven pace at which states have fortified their own CCB. These works allude to a couple limitations in the extant counter-terrorism literature vis-à-vis online-based tools. First, much of the work has yet to systematically analyze variations in governments’ ability to strengthen their ability to monitor or regulate the Internet. Second, authors have noted that considerable variation exists as far as CCB throughout the world. Given the increasing reliance on the Internet and social media platforms by terrorist groups, additional investigation is needed to uncover to what extent lax online regulation plays in terrorist activity. To address this puzzle, we analyze data over a 20-year period for roughly 100 democratic and authoritarian states using V-dem and Digital Society Project data. The results of numerous analyses underscore the link between weak government regulation and terrorist activity.\n\n\nArticles\n“Regional Contrasts in County-Level Public Management: Cultural Influences and Administrative Dynamics”\nIntroduction Public management research often focuses on municipalities within individual states, raising questions about broader applicability due to cultural and historical variations across subregions in America. To address this gap, our study examines county-level data across states, and regions, aiming to shed light on rural public management differences. Methodology Using county-level data as our unit of analysis, we examine local government structures to discern how local factors and regional characteristics impact public management patterns. Data sources and specific analysis methods will be detailed in the final paper. Hypothesis Drawing from Elazar’s subculture theory (1966), we hypothesize that counties within traditionalistic regions (e.g., the American South) may exhibit unique characteristics in their public administration. Specifically, we anticipate differences in the backgrounds and educational profiles of county administrators, results in a stronger reliance on local elites and less emphasis on formal education. Conclusion This research uncovers how regional subcultures influence county-level public management. By exploring these nuances, we aim to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of how cultural contexts shape administrative practices."

Darrell then contacted Drs. Keith Lee and Joseph Robbins (both at VSU) to secure their assistance in designing and analyzing a Needs Assessment survey targeting residents from 11 counties in South Georgia (i.e., Atkinson, Bacon, Berrien, Brooks, Clinch, Coffee, Echols, Jeff Davis, Lanier, Lowndes, and Ware County). Smith explained that his goal for this project was to better understand how the economic and COVID-19 strains have impacted residents in these counties, assess the mental and psychological needs of these residents, and then to identify the nonprofit services being used (or needed) in the GVUW’s service region. The survey was designed and then launched in January 2023 and concluded at the end of April 2023. All told, 1,300 survey responses were received during the survey period thanks to the help of numerous nonprofit organizations, who were instrumental in spreading the word.

    "text": "Project Overview\nLee County is in the heart of Southwest Georgia and is a rapidly growing community attracting young families to the excellent school system, while providing a moderate climate and beautiful landscape interspersed with creeks, lakes, plantations, and traditional rural character. The southern portion of the county supports most of the residential, commercial, and industrial development. The City of Leesburg is home to the school system and governmental buildings and serves as the county seat. Lee County is dedicated to encouraging a healthy mix of land uses while protecting and preserving prime agricultural areas for continued agricultural and agriculturally oriented uses. The intent is to preserve the open character of the area and protect the business of agriculture. The northern portion of the county is predominantly zoned AG-1 (Active Agriculture District) and supports productive farm operations. Natural resources and abundant wildlife offer recreational opportunities and scenic corridors to this important area. Quality, well-planned growth and the provision of community services is important, and the county strives to ensure a balance of revenue and expenditures.\nIn January 2020, a Solar Energy Systems (SES) Ordinance (Chapter 70, Article XXI) was adopted by the county, and provides for the siting, construction, installation and decommissioning, general and specific requirements of any new SES facility, to be constructed and operated in the AG-1 zone, within the unincorporated area of Lee County. Numerous formal and informal inquiries regarding intermediate and large-scale solar energy system facilities have been received within the recent past.\nThe Board of Commissioners is concerned about the potential of substantial loss of existing agricultural land and farming operations within the county due to large scale solar energy system construction and operation. Certain proposals include requests for ad valorem tax abatements to finance construction of such solar facilities. It is not clear to the Board of Commissioners whether such proposed ad valorem tax abatements for the personal property of the solar array installed for the large-scale SES facilities have a positive or negative long-term effect on the county’s ad valorem tax revenue.\nOn January 26, 2021, a Moratorium was declared upon the issuance of a conditional use permit for any large-scale SES facility through August 1, 2021. During this time, Lee County commissioned Valdosta State University to complete a careful and deliberate study of the short-term and long-term effects of financing the construction of SES facilities in Lee County through the use of revenue bonds and the use of long-term personal property ad valorem tax abatements to convince such large scale SES facilities to locate in Lee County, as well as the effect of such personal property tax abatements upon the ad valorem tax revenues of Lee County.\nThis report contains the results of this study. The impact of SES facilities was assessed in terms of two categories, fiscal impacts to county revenue sources and environmental impacts to land and property. The former category includes effects of using revenue bonds to incentivize SES development in Lee County, which produce positive fiscal impacts for the county. The latter category, however, includes impacts on agricultural land, viewshed and aesthetics, which can be negative when SES uses are inappropriately sited."
