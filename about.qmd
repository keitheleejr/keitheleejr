I am an Associate Professor of Political Science at Valdosta State University, where I teach courses on Congress, Southern Politics, and Public Management. In the Master of Public Administration (MPA) program, I guide current and aspiring public managers through applied research and quantitative methods, emphasizing analytical rigor and practical relevance.

My research focuses on American political institutions, Southern politics, and public management, with a commitment to public impact. I am a published author whose work has appeared in peer-reviewed journals and been presented at professional conferences. Iâ€™ve co-authored a textbook on public policy, served in leadership roles with the Georgia Political Science Association, and consult with local governments and nonprofit organizations to support evidence-informed decision-making.

I currently serve on numerous dissertation committees, reflecting a sustained investment in graduate education and scholarly development. My approach to teaching and mentorship centers on demystifying complex ideas and fostering intellectual confidence.

My forthcoming book, *R for Public Managers* (Taylor & Francis), aims to make data literacy more accessible for students and practitioners in public service. Whether through lectures, research, or informal conversations, my goal is consistent: help people think more clearly, lead more confidently, and feel just a bit less alone in the learning process.
