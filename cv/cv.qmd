[Article] "Regional Contrasts in County-Level Public Management: Cultural Influences and Administrative Dynamics" with Joseph Robbins. 

<br/><br/>

_Introduction_ Public management research often focuses on municipalities within individual states, raising questions about broader applicability due to cultural and historical variations across subregions in America. To address this gap, our study examines county-level data across states, and regions, aiming to shed light on rural public management differences. _Methodology_ Using county-level data as our unit of analysis, we examine local government structures to discern how local factors and regional characteristics impact public management patterns. Data sources and specific analysis methods will be detailed in the final paper. _Hypothesis_ Drawing from Elazar's subculture theory (1966), we hypothesize that counties within traditionalistic regions (e.g., the American South) may exhibit unique characteristics in their public administration. Specifically, we anticipate differences in the backgrounds and educational profiles of county administrators, results in a stronger reliance on local elites and less emphasis on formal education. _Conclusion_ This research seeks to uncover how regional subcultures influence county-level public management. By exploring these nuances, we aim to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of how cultural contexts shape administrative practices.
