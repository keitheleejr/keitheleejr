The South Georgia Medical Center (SGMC) is pleased to present these 2023 Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNA) for the Berrien Campus in Nashville, Georgia and the Lanier Campus in Lakeland Georgia. The plans were developed by SGMC staff in conjunction with Drs. Keith Lee and Joseph Robbins (Valdosta State University faculty) and Valdosta State Universityâ€™s Center for South Georgia Regional Impact (led by Darrell Moore). Lee, Robbins, and Moore have extensive consulting experience, having worked with numerous public and private organizations.

This CHNA is based on information gathered from a variety of sources, including:

1. Focus group interviews with community advocates and stakeholders who are knowledgeable about public health and healthcare issues;

2. A community survey of Berrien County residents; and,

3. Secondary data compiled from national, state, and local agencies and organizations.
