The South Georgia Medical Center (SGMC) is pleased to present this 2023 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) for the Berrien Campus in Nashville, Georgia and teh Lanier Campus in Lakeland Georgia. The plans were developed by SGMC staff in conjunction with Drs. Keith Lee and Joseph Robbins (Valdosta State University faculty) and Valdosta State University's Center for South Georgia Regional Impact (led by Darrell Moore).
