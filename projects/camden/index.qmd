## Project Overview

Steven Sainz, Camden Connection's CEO, submitted a draft plan of action to Darrell Moore at the Center for South Georgia Regional Impact regarding a needs assessment survey in October 2021. Darrell reached out to us and requested our assistance in conducting the survey soon thereafter. We were later asked on April 18, 2022 to include survey questions that would be used to support their application for a Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) from Georgia Department of Community Affairs (DCA). The anonymous survey was approved by Valdosta State University's Institutional Review Board (IRB) in June 2022 and responses were gathered from June 27, 2022 through December 17, 2022. The survey received 722 responses, with 232 responses from the CDBG target area. This report outlines our survey methodology and the resulting analysis.
