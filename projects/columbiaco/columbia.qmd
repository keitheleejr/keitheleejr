The Center for South Georgia Regional Impact (CSGRI), at Valdosta State University
responded to a request for proposal (RFP) and was selected to develop an analysis of
the fiscal feasibility of the proposed Columbia City. The analysis's purpose is to
estimate the study area's ability to meet its expenditures with available revenue sources.
This report provides estimates of revenues and expenditures that a potential Columbia
City, if incorporated, could expect in providing certain municipal services for a single
fiscal year. We also spoke with individuals at related institutions and governments and
researched current legislation at the state and local level.
