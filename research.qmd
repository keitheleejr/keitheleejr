## Works in Progress

_Southern Echoes and Shattered Illusions: A Memoir of Awakening_ 

I am currently working on a memoir about my experiences growing up in the South and how those experiences shaped my political views. More importantly, I am writing about how my views have changed over time and how I have come to see the world differently. This is primarily a personal project, but I hope to have it published in the next few years.

_Southern Subnational Authoritarianism: A Repressive Response to the People's Party_  

This book delves into the emergence of the People's Party in the Southern region and analyzes the ensuing reaction from the Democratic Party. My contention is that the Democratic Party's reaction to the People's Party amounted to a subnational authoritarian approach aimed at suppressing individuals linked to the populist movement, specifically targeting African Americans and impoverished whites. The study builds on the work of V.O. Key's _Southern Politics in State and Nation_, Edward Gibson's _Boundary Control_, and Richard Bensel's _Sectionalism and American Political Development_, among others. 

"Regional Contrasts in County-Level Public Management: Cultural Influences and Administrative Dynamics" with Joseph Robbins. 

_Introduction_ Research in public management often focuses on municipalities within individual states, raising questions about broader applicability due to cultural and historical variations across regions. To address this gap, our study examines county-level data across different regions, aiming to shed light on rural public management differences. _Methodology_ We focus on county-level data, leveraging it as an administrative unit for analysis. By comparing counties across regions, we aim to discern distinct public management patterns. Data sources and specific analysis methods will be detailed in the final paper. _Hypothesis_ Drawing from Elazar's subculture theory (1966), we hypothesize that counties within traditionalistic regions (e.g., the American South) may exhibit unique characteristics in their public administration. Specifically, we anticipate differences in the backgrounds and educational profiles of county administrators, reflecting a stronger reliance on local elites and less emphasis on formal education. _Conclusion_ This research seeks to uncover how regional subcultures influence county-level public management. By exploring these nuances, we aim to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of how cultural contexts shape administrative practices.
