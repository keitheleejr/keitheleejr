By blending theory with practice, _R for Public Managers_ equips you with the confidence and skills to make data-driven decisions that drive better public outcomes.

_Congress at the Crossroads: Revisiting Dodd and Reimagining Reform_  
Edited by Keith E. Lee Jr. and Kevin Baron  

Congress stands at a historic inflection point, marked by heightened polarization, institutional logjams, and evolving party forces. In this edited volume, former students of Dr. Larry Dodd examine Congress through a Doddian lens to illuminate how past patterns of party empowerment, committee reform, and realignment continue to shape today’s legislature. Through rich historical case studies, original empirical analyses, and forward-looking essays, contributors diagnose current challenges, from gridlock and executive-legislative tensions to committee turf wars, and propose pragmatic pathways for revitalizing congressional capacity. By bridging Dodd’s classic insights with contemporary realities, _Congress at the Crossroads_ offers students, scholars, and reform advocates a fresh, cycle-informed framework for understanding and reimagining the future of the U.S. House and Senate.

"Cyber Capabilities and Counterterrorism"

Following the attacks on 9/11, many countries throughout the world looked to shore up Internet regulation in order to thwart future attacks (Watney 2007). Rich, analytical summations of different legal, ethical, or policy-based discussions of efforts to counter terrorism through various regulatory means (e.g., West 2021). One strand of such work follows the evolution of cybersecurity capacity building (CCB), whereby scholars such as Pawlak and Barmpaliou (2016) have commented on the uneven pace at which states have fortified their own CCB. These works allude to a couple limitations in the extant counter-terrorism literature vis-à-vis online-based tools. First, much of the work has yet to systematically analyze variations in governments’ ability to strengthen their ability to monitor or regulate the Internet. Second, authors have noted that considerable variation exists as far as CCB throughout the world. Given the increasing reliance on the Internet and social media platforms by terrorist groups, additional investigation is needed to uncover to what extent lax online regulation plays in terrorist activity. To address this puzzle, we analyze data over a 20-year period for roughly 100 democratic and authoritarian states using V-dem and Digital Society Project data. The results of numerous analyses underscore the link between weak government regulation and terrorist activity.

"Regional Contrasts in County-Level Public Management: Cultural Influences and Administrative Dynamics" 

_Introduction_ Public management research often focuses on municipalities within individual states, raising questions about broader applicability due to cultural and historical variations across subregions in America. To address this gap, our study examines county-level data across states, and regions, aiming to shed light on rural public management differences. _Methodology_ Using county-level data as our unit of analysis, we examine local government structures to discern how local factors and regional characteristics impact public management patterns. Data sources and specific analysis methods will be detailed in the final paper. _Hypothesis_ Drawing from Elazar's subculture theory (1966), we hypothesize that counties within traditionalistic regions (e.g., the American South) may exhibit unique characteristics in their public administration. Specifically, we anticipate differences in the backgrounds and educational profiles of county administrators, results in a stronger reliance on local elites and less emphasis on formal education. _Conclusion_ This research uncovers how regional subcultures influence county-level public management. By exploring these nuances, we aim to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of how cultural contexts shape administrative practices.
