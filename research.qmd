## Works in Progress

_Southern Echoes and Shattered Illusions: A Memoir of Awakening_ 

I am currently working on a memoir about my experiences growing up in the South and how those experiences shaped my political views. More importantly, I am writing about how my views have changed over time and how I have come to see the world differently. This is primarily a personal project, but I hope to have it published in the next few years.

_Southern Subnational Authoritarianism: A Repressive Response to the People's Party_  

This book delves into the emergence of the People's Party in the Southern region and analyzes the ensuing reaction from the Democratic Party. My contention is that the Democratic Party's reaction to the People's Party amounted to a subnational authoritarian approach aimed at suppressing individuals linked to the populist movement, specifically targeting African Americans and impoverished whites. The study builds on the work of V.O. Key's _Southern Politics in State and Nation_, Edward Gibson's _Boundary Control_, and Richard Bensel's _Sectionalism and American Political Development_, among others. 

"Rural Public Management and Political Culture: An Comparative Analysis of County Level Public Management in America" with Joseph Robbins. 

This project examines the impact of political subcultures on public management in rural counties across the United States. We are currently in the process of collecting data. We will present the paper at the Citadel Symposium on Southern Politics in March 2024.
